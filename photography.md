Capturing moments is one of my favorite hobbies.  I especially love taking photos when I am traveling, at home and abroad.  

I shoot with a Nikon d3200 with a 50mm fixed lens, as well as with my iPhone 6 camera.  Obviously, the Nikon performs leaps and bounds better than the iPhone, but both still get the job done. 

* Here are a couple of my favorite photos: 
  * This photo is from a cross-country road trip that I took with three of my friends.  I took this photo as we were hiking to a lake in Arapaho National Forest.

  * The photo below was from the same trip with my buddies.  It was taken in Manti La Sal National Forest in Utah:  quite literally a mountain oasis amongst a desert.
