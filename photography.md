Capturing moments is one of my favorite hobbies.  I especially love taking photos when I am traveling, at home and abroad.  

I shoot with a Nikon d3200 with a 50mm fixed lens, as well as with my iPhone 6 camera.  Obviously, the Nikon performs leaps and bounds better than the iPhone, but both still get the job done.
