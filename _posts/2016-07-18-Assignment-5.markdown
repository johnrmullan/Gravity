For this assignment, our group worked to take data from a .csv file and put into a database format.
We took our script from Assignment 4 and used that for this assignment.  
The script asks a series of questions that the user can answer.  These answers are then stores in a file which is transfomed into a .csv file.
From there, the script goes into MySQL and inputs the data into a database format.  From there, the script transforms the data into a .sql file.
