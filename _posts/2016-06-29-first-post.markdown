This is my first blog post.  I am learning how to build a website in my class, INLS 161.  

It's a pretty interesting  class; it's my first course for my Information Systems minor.  

Here is a link to the School of Information and Library Science at [UNC](https://sils.unc.edu/)! 

Here is a photo of Manning Hall; this the School of Information and Library Science is located.
