During the first semester of my sophomore year, I took a class titles Energy Economics.  For this class, we were instructed to complete a term paper
on any topic relating to energy.  

The title of my paper is "Economic, Environmental, and Political Implications of Future Large-Scale Lithium-Ion Battery Storage". 
This paper investigates essentially all effects that lithium-ion battery storage would have if it were to be implemented in a major way.  

Lithium-Ion Battery Storage is becoming a major topic for a variety of reasons. As fossil fuels inevitably run scarce and as renewable energy becomes
increasingly popular, finding cost-effective and safe storage methods for electricity becomes a necessity.  The need for energy storage stems from 
the variability of electricity production from renewable sources (As the saying goes, "With renewables, there's no power if the sun doesn't shine
and the wind doesn't blow!") Thus, storage will become increasingly important in the future.  For this paper, I aggregated and analyzed research 
regarding lithium-ion storage systems, from the extraction of the necessary metals to the production process to the life-cycle of the systems. 
The results were much more interesting than I initially expected, as wide-scale lithium-ion storage has global implications, as is demonstrated throughout
the paper.  As renewable energy gains more market share, lithium-ion storage systems will likely become a huge part of everyday life, which has both negative 
and positive ramifications. 

To get my document into multiple forms, I used Pandoc, which is a document converter that can - for all intents and purposes - convert between any
type of document.  In order to actually convert my document, I created a scipt that took an input (my document in markdown) and ran Pandoc several times
to get the document into the forms that are linked below.  At the bottom of this post is a link to the script I created. 

Below are links to my paper in several different formats (.docx, .html, .odt, and .pdf):
