# School Cafeteria Discards Assessment Project (SCrAP)

I began my internship at EREF (Environmental Research and Education Foundation) in April of this year. I've loved the experience so far and am excited to be working on a huge project for the foundation, SCrAP.I

Roughly 40% of food produced in the United States is thrown away.  At EREF, our mission is to fund and direct scientific research and educational initiatives for waste management practices to benefit the solid waste industry and the communities it serves.Roughly

As part of our goal to better understand food waste in the United States, we are working to better understand many things about food waste:

* How much food waste is generated (and solid waste in general)
  * By Volume and Mass

* How much solid waste is generated by each sector of the economy
  * Institutional
    * Schools
    * Hospitals
    * Prisons
    * Etc.
  * Commercial 
    * Restaurants
    * Shopping Malls
    * Big-Box Stores
    * Etc. 
  * Hospitality
    * Casinos
    * Hotels, Motels, Inns
    * Etc.
