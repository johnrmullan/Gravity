<p>Capturing moments is one of my favorite hobbies. I especially love taking photos when I am traveling, at home and abroad.</p>
<p>I shoot with a Nikon d3200 with a 50mm fixed lens, as well as with my iPhone 6 camera. Obviously, the Nikon performs leaps and bounds better than the iPhone, but both still get the job done.</p>
<ul>
<li>Here are a couple of my favorite photos:</li>
<li>This photo is from a cross-country road trip that I took with three of my friends. I took this photo as we were hiking to a lake in Arapaho National Forest. <img width="500px" alt="Arapaho" src="https://github.com/johnrmullan/johnrmullan.github.io/blob/master/_photos/_DSC0443.JPG?raw=true" /></li>
<li>The photo below was from the same trip with my buddies. It was taken in Manti La Sal National Forest in Utah: quite literally a mountain oasis amongst a desert. <img width="500px" alt="Manti La Sal" src="https://github.com/johnrmullan/johnrmullan.github.io/blob/master/_photos/_DSC0443.JPG?raw=true" /></li>
</ul>
